This is 9menu, a simple program that allows you to create X menus from the
shell, where each menu item will run a command. 9menu is intended for use
with 9wm, but can be used with any other window manager.

The idea of a command line menu generator is from xmenu, but xmenu was
exclusively a pop-up menu, not what I wanted.

The files are:

README			--- this file
9menu.1			--- man page for 9menu
9menu.c			--- source code
Imakefile		--- a contributed Imakefile,
			    from Bengt Kleberg <bengt@softwell.se>
Makefile.noimake	--- a simple makefile.
meson.build             --- for people who prefer meson.
