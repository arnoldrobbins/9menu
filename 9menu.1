.SH DESCRIPTION
.I 9menu
is a simple program that accepts a list of menu item and command
pairs on the command line.
It creates a window that consists of nothing but a menu.
When a particular item is selected, the corresponding command is executed.
.PP
Either
.B Button1
or
.B Button3
may be used to select an item.
Alternatively, the UP-ARROW and DOWN-ARROW cursor keys may be used to
highlight different items, with ENTER used to select the
highlighted item.
.PP
Menu items and commands are separated by a colon.  The colon and command
are optional. If they are missing, then the menu item is assumed to be
a command that can be executed directly.
.PP
A menu item consisting of the word
.B exit
causes
.I 9menu
to exit when it is selected.
Otherwise, to stop
.I 9menu ,
delete it using the window manager.
The
.B exit
menu item can be anywhere in the list, although by convention it is last.
If a command is supplied along with the
.B exit
item, that command is executed before
.I 9menu
exits.
.PP
If a menu item's command starts with the word
.BR exec ,
.I 9menu
ceases operating after launching it.
.PP
.I 9menu
accepts the following command line options,
listed alphabetically:
.TP
.BI \-bg " background-color"
Set the background color to
.IR background-color .
By default, the background color is white.
.TP
.BI \-display " displayname"
Use the X display
.IR displayname ,
instead of the default display.
.TP
.BI \-file " filename"
Read items to display from
.IR filename ,
in addition to any other command line arguments.  This is intended for use
with
.B #!
in scripts.
A
.I filename
of
.B -
causes
.I 9menu
to read items from standard input.
.TP
.BI \-fg " foreground-color"
Set the foreground color to
.IR foreground-color .
By default, the foreground color is black.
.TP
.BI \-font " fname"
Use the font
.IR fname ,
instead of one of the default fonts built into
.IR 9wm .
.TP
.BI \-geometry " geom"
Use
.I geom
(a geometry in standard X format) as the geometry of the menu.
This is most useful for specifying the initial location of the menu.
Note that
.I 9menu
overrides the size part of the geometry specification. The window is
always just large enough to hold the menu.
.TP
.B \-iconic
Start up in the iconified state.
.TP
.BI \-label " name"
Change both the window and icon labels of the window to
.IR name .
The default label is the last component of the path used to run
.IR 9menu ,
typically,
.BR 9menu .
.TP
.B \-path
Append the current directory to the command search path.
.TP
.B \-popdown
Once an item is selected, the menu window automatically iconifies itself.
.TP
.B \-popup
Act like a pop-up menu. Once a menu item is selected,
.I 9menu
exits.
This option overrides
.BR \-popdown .
.TP
.BI \-shell " prog"
Use
.I prog
as the shell to run commands, instead of
.BR /bin/sh .
A popular alternative shell is
.IR rc (1).
If the shell cannot be executed,
.I 9menu
then
.I silently
falls back to using
.BR /bin/sh .
.TP
.B \-teleport
Move the menu to where the mouse is when the menu is uniconified.
This option is particularly useful when combined with
.BR \-popdown .
.TP
.B \-version
This option prints the version of
.I 9menu
on the standard output, and then exits with an exit value of zero.
.TP
.B \-warp
Warp the mouse to the menu when the menu is uniconified.
After the selection is made, restore the mouse to where it was.
This option is particularly useful when combined with
.BR \-popdown .

.SH AUTHORS
The initial idea for this program was by Arnold Robbins, after having
worked with John Mackin's GWM Blit emulation.
Matty Farrow wrote a version using libXg, from which some ideas were borrowed.
This code was written by David Hogan and Arnold Robbins.
Rich Salz motivated the
.B \-shell
option.
Christopher Platt motivated the
.B \-teleport
option.
John O'Donnell supplied the basic code for the
.B \-fg
and
.B \-bg
options.
Peter Seebach provided the base code for the
.B \-file
and
.B \-path
options.
Matthias Bauer made it work with the keyboard.
